# Sisense Embed SDK Demo Hitting Bandwidth Sisense Instance
This project is a demo of Sisense's Embed SDK hitting Bandwidth's Sisense Instance and is intended to be a prototyping environment for any analytics work at Bandwidth that will utilize the Sisense SDK.

This Application requires SSO authentication to view the Bandwidth Sisense Dashboards, so if the Okta account is not granted permission to the Sisense Dashboard, application will not load the dashboard display. Reach out to Justin Scott jscott@bandiwdth.com with any questions on getting access.

The Sisense Embed SDK is a Javascript library used to embed Sisense dashboards into other web pages in an interactive manner, available in Sisense V8.1 and up.

> *Note: this demo utilizes some features available only with Sisense V8.1.1 and higher*

The repository includes all the assets (such as an Elasticube and dashboards) required to set up this demo. Below you will find instructions for set up, customization and contributions.

For more information about the Sisense Embed SDK, please visit the [Sisense Embed SDK documentation](https://developer.sisense.com/display/API2/Embed+SDK)

## Setting up this demo

> Make sure you have met the following prerequisites prior to starting:
>  - [Installed `Sisense V8.1.1`](https://documentation.sisense.com/latest/getting-started/download-install.htm) on your server and activated it
>  - [Set up CORS](https://documentation.sisense.com/latest/content/cors.htm)
>  - [Set up SSO](https://documentation.sisense.com/latest/administration/user-management/single-sign-on/introduction-sso.htm) (Optional - you can manually log in to Sisense in another tab to create a cookie)
>  - Have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed and up-to-date

1. Clone or download this repository
1. The demo uses one of the sample Datamodels included with Sisense called "Sample ECommerce".  
If you don't already have this Datamodel, Import the Elasticube file (`.ecdata`) included in the `assets` folder to your Sisense server
1. Import the Dashboard files (`.dash`) included in the `assets` folder to your Sisense server
1. Open the `index.html` file using any text editor and:
   1. Locate the line `<!-- Get iFrame SDK -->`
	1. Beneath it, update the URL in the `script` tag to match your Sisense server's IP/host and port: `<script src="http://localhost:8081/js/frame.js"></script>`
1. Open the `config.js` file using any text editor or IDE and:
   1. Update the `baseUrl` property to match your Sisense server's IP/host and port
   1. Update the `dashboards` array with the OIDs of your imported dashboards
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start` to start a local dev server, which will automatically open the demo in your browser.  
   _If a tab doesn't open automatically, navigate to http://localhost:8887/index.html_
